# unofficial version of PLL for playing around

This is a clone of the Phylogenetic Likelihood Library http://www.libpll.org/

Code in this repo is unstable work-in-progress 
modification of the real PLL. Modifications by Mark Holder and Liam Heins.

*Please* use the real version of the PLL, not this one. It is being
shared on GitHub to ease communication about the code, but is not
intended for widespread use.

Implementation of the strndup function for NON_POSIX build by:
    Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi at-symbol-here caip.rutgers.edu>.
